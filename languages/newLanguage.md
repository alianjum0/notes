# Learning a new language

1. research information and resources. search about the language. What type of language it is, dialect.
2. find comprehensible input. that can be understood despite of not
   understanding all the words and grammatical structures with expressions and environment.
3. Create an immersive environment, listen as much as possible even don't
   understand. find a self teaching book and start learning the language.
4. Choose one resource, there are too many choices, don't get confused. Assimil
   for European languages.
Use a self teaching book. Read and listen it at the same time for multiple
times.
5. use translation to know new words. translate from native language to new language and new to native language. Get basic pattern of a language with few words and then build upon it. Then
go into the details.
